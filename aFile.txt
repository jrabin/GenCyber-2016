TERMINAL NOTES
man sl--> HELP MANUAL
whatis --> will tell you what a command is
pwd --> shows you absolute address 
cd --> changes directory you are in, cd Desktop will move you into desktop
touch fileName.txt --> creates file if file doesn't already exist
gedit fileName.txt &--> is a text editor, allows you to open and edit files
	the & at the end essentially sends command to different processor
cat fileName.txt --> shows contents of folder
	as opposed to more fileName.txt which does the same, but can only scroll down
	also less fileName.txt which allows you to scroll up and down

head aFile.txt and tail aFile.txt--> displays the header and footer of file

echo hi >> dFile.txt --> will create dFile.txt containing the word hi, or add hi to pre-existing dFile.txt

tar -cf hello.tar aFile.txt--> creates a tar file by the name of hello.tar, with aFile inside of it

mkdir --> creates directory where you are currently located

cd.. --> changes your location to one directory level up
	. is where you are
	.. is one above where sl you are

mv fileName.txt location--> moves file

wc --> command tells you how many lines, words and letters in a given file
sudo
command --help --> will help you figure out what that does

cp fileName.txt fDir/ --> copies file into different directory (in this case into fDir)
rm fileName.txt --> removes file
rm -r gDir/ --> removes directory

ls -l--> shows files with even more info, like date and author and permissions
ls -al--> shows all hidden files

sudo apt-get install--> installs app

drwxr-xr-x 3--> permissions, first d stands for directory, dash is 0 (=no permission) and letter 			is 1 (=permission)
owner(3)/group(3)/public(3)	Note: rwx stands for read, write and execute

Binary looks like this: think about it like adding 1+9=10
0 =1
1 =2
01 =3
11 =4
100 =5
101 =6
110 =7
111 =8

exit--> closes terminal

INTRO TO PYTHON
Spyder IDE (Ideal developing environment) consists of file editor and console.
#COMMENTING
Variable= name that stores information (a value), includes strings (words in quotes), integers 			(whole number), booleans (true/false), and floats (decimal)
	assigned with an equal sign, but order matters, variable name MUST be on left side of = 		and value must be on the right
Integers= any whole number including negatives, can apply addition/subtraction/division/multiplication

my_age = my_age+time is the same as my_age+=time
print()
also x/y will give you 4.0 which is a float, but x//y will give you 4 which is an integer

String= basically any form of text, distinguished by quotation marks, can be indexed, have lengths (number of characters and white spaces between quotation marks)
	D i d   S o l o   s h  o   o t      f i   r  s  t  ?
	0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  19  20
	--> can access specific characters by typing unknown(4) which will give you S in this example
	--> string_name.find("any phrase", start_index, end_index) will return index if found and -1 if not found

	string1="Hello, world"
	print(string1[2])
	has an output of l

	string1.find("wor")
	has an output of 7, because that is where it is found w/in the string
	
	-->print(len(string)) will give you 6, literally the length of the string
	--> to print integer and string variables in one statement, separate each variable with commas, like so:
	string1="There are"
	int1=24
	string2="laptops in this room and"
	string3="people"
	int2=28
	print(string1, int1, string2, int2, string3) 
	gives you There are 24 laptops in this room and 28 people

	--> Getting user input? 	
	studentname = input("What is your name, student?")
	print ("Hello,", studentname)

	--> What about getting user input with different integer types?
	age = input ("enter an age") #will give you an error
	age = int(input ("enter an age")) #will convert string into an integer

% is called mod--> gives remainder, of x/y, written as x%y
compiling--> computer program reads and checks what you've wrote... picks up syntax errors

To comment in Python, you can use #, or ''' for multiple lined comments '''
To convert an integer into a string--> str(a), whereas to convert string to integer--> int(a)

Computers communicate in Base 2 ("binary")
--based on switches, like the flow of electric current, on/off
--modern switches have millions of tiny switches, measured in nanometers
--two symbols/bits: 0,1
vs. Decimal System which is Base 10
--ten symbols/digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
vs. Octal (Base 8), or like Base 6
vs. Hexadecimal(Base 16)
--convenient because 16 numbers can be represented with 4 bits
--but we don't have enough digits to represent all 16 of these symbols... only 10 digits
--solution:use letters too
--symbols:0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F 

*To convert binary to base 10, multiply the rightmost bit by a power of 2, starting with 2^0, the continuously add the product of the next left bit and the next power of 2.
To convert base 10 to binary, find the greatest power of 2 that can "fit" inside the number, subtract this from the number, and repeat. If the power of 2 is too large, then write zero. Note that it helps to create a chart.--> EASIER WAY includes divisng number repeatedly by 2, saving remainder and then REVERSING order of remainders
	i.e. 43%2=1 21%2=1 10%2=0 5%2=1 2%2=0 1%2=1 -->  101011
Base 10 example: 2,735--> 2x10^3 + 7x10^2 + 3x10^1 + 5x 10^0
Base 2 example: 1101--> 1x2^3 + 1x2^2 + 0x2^1 + 1x2^0--> 12
*To convert hex to binary, separate the binary into the four "high order bits" on the left and the four "lower order bits" on the right. Each represents a number between 0 and 15 which we replace by its hex symbol.

PYTHON COMMAND FOR CONVERSION: bin() and hex()

Bits, Bytes and Words:
A bit is a single binary symbol, 0 or 1.
A byte is 8 bits.
A computer word is several bytes. Common word sizes are 32 bit words (4 bytes) and 64 bit words (8 bytes). Word size of computer determines the largest integer that can be represented on it.

Note: Can represent 10^n and 2^n numbers with n digits

There are 10 kinds of people in this world: those who understand binary, and those who don't.

ASCII: used to represent text
--each character (letter, digit, punctuation mark, space, tab, etc) corresponds to a number
--originally used 7 bits to represent 128 diff characters
--capital letters start at decimal 65 with 'A'
ord()-- given an ASCII character, the function will output the number it is represented by
chr()--given an number, the function will output the ASCII character it represents

	*Why might this be important? CRYPTOGRAPHY OOH AHH, and also can convert into hexadecimal and binary 

list.append(object)

STOLEN OSCAR PROMPT
myspace--> soundcloud--> myspace--> okcupid--> instagram--> phone number

Conditional Statements (If, elif and else)
--if a certain condition is met, then the corresponding action will occur
--if the condition is not met (false), then the code inside of the conitional is skipped and the rest of the code continues to run
--if- the first conditional
  elif- stands for "else if", used after "if"
  else- the "catch all", has no conditional statement
--True/false (Boulian) dependent on comparisons, runs only when these relationships are true, like
  Equality A==B #runmycode
  Inequality A!=B #runmycode
  Relativity, like < or > or <= or >=
-- Way to tell if # is even--> A%2==0

Functions
--block of code that can be repeatedly used for efficiency-- don't have to write out everything again
--initiated using parentheses, object w/in parentheses is known as the parameter
--return refers to giving back a result from the code
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
	if parameter1>parameter2:
		print("I don't like this")
		break #allows you to break from the function without returning to anything
	else:
		break
--What is the difference between = and ==? == is used for Boulivian, like true/false type situation

Cybersecurity First Principles
1. Domain Separation- keeps separate things apart, like keeping different users separate from each other

2. Process Isolation- keeps different programs separate, so Chrome and Microsoft cannot access each others' information/data

3. Resource Encapsulation- keeps resources separate 

4. Least Privilege- users have limited permissions to do things, like read, write and execute permissions (i.e. only police officers can arrest people)

5. Layering- layers of security make it harder to break in, so the network layer, computer layer and hardware layer serve as protections

6. Abstraction- representing code in the most simple way possible (as opposed to in the most complex way possible)

7. Information Hiding- controlling which parts of code can control other parts

8. Modularity- breaking code up into smaller parts, has the ultimate goal of efficiency and easy editing 

9. Simplicity of Design- make things/code as simple as possible	

Intro to Loops
While loop- loop that will keep on running code until a certain condition is met
	    stops running after condition is met


A library is a collection of functions, which can be imported into your own code for your own usage.--> the random library allows you to use random.randint(a,b)

Note: Typing a function into the console will allow you to see the proper arrangment, such as what type of parameters are required
	Also EOL stands for "end of the line." Check to make sure all " are ended by ".--> SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal "EOL" stands for "end of line". An EOL error means that Python hit the end. of a line while going through a string. This can be because you forgot ending quotes , or because you tried. to make a string extend past one line. Strings enclosed in single or double quotes.

Remeber: for char in string --> will allow you to loop through each character in a string
len(string) gives you the length of a string
ASCII table capital/lowercase

Intro to Cryptography
-- What is it? The act of securing information, whether it be an image, text or audio clip
		used during times of war, and also for privacy purposes (corporate or otherwise)
--Caesar Cipher- method involves shifting all of the letters in your message by a certain number
		inner ring signifies actuall alphabet, while outher ring is the alphabet that has 		been shifted by say 10
		BUT THERE ARE ONLY 25 WAYS TO ENCRYPT A MESSAGE USING CAESAR CIPHER, and a 		computer is more than capable of trying all 25 methods in a second
--Caesar Cipher Pseudo-code:
1. Name your function, two parameters, string and integer.
2. Create a string that will contain no characters.
	emptystring=""
3. a. Start a for loop that loops through each character in you unencrypted message.number into
   b. Turn each character into an SCII number using the ord function.
   c. Save that ASCII number into variable
   d. Add the shift to the ASCII variable
   e. Have a conditional statement that will subtract from the ASCII variable if it's greater than the range of letters
   f. Change ASCII variable to a character using the function chr()
   g. emptystring+= character_variable
4. Return the encrypted string

Remember: You can add to strings
string = ""
string += "a" --> string= string + "a"

--One Time Pad (The Ultimate Shift Cipher)- the only mathematically unbreakable encryption, it is 	a cryptographic algorithm/formula, encodes using a key and a message
	even if you tried using "brute force" for every second of your life...still probs wouldn't 	work 
	1. Plain text: HELLO
	2. Convert into numbers: 77 4 11 11 14
	3. Key: J F K L O, and then convert into numbers 9 5 10 11 14
	4. Cipher text(encoded version of text, add numbers) 16 9 21 22 28, then mod % by 26, which gives you 16 9 21 22 2, which you then convert to letters Q J V W C
	5. The cipher text is what you send!

Note: a%b=a if a<b

Message=Plaintext

New Technology File System (NTFS)
--Blocks: 
	data blocks (stores content stored inside file)
	inode blocks (stores info about file location- physical address, inode #s start @ 5)
	allocation bit map blocks (stores 0s and 1s, on & off switches that dictate availability of blocks) 

	--> 6 types of blocks
	Boot 0
	Super 1
	Inode Block, Allocation Bit Map 2-5
	Data Block, Allocation Bit Map 6-8
	Inode Blocks 9-1883
	Data blocks 1884-20000

	--> Small Scale Representation
	Inode #:5    5-4=1, place a 1 in the 1st block (to save space), in 5th block data #s are specified
	Data Numbers: 8, 10, 11, 14, dictate where the data is located

Zip file--> super compact file, stores big stuff in less space
pizzaPug.jpeg--> stored as series of 1s and 0s, binary, if you change just one byte in the header you will corrupt the file (used by college students to get extensions on assignments)
file carving
Autopsy--> if you delete a file you can get it back SOMETIMES, putting something in the trash is equivalent of the computer forgetting where it is and replacing it with something else
	actually a program used by the gov't to recover files

Image Hashing:
captchalogue-- take out of inventory
	vowels=1 and consonants=2 add it all up, then mod by space you have (%)
collision-- when two different things go in the same box, bad bcuz diff. to differentiate
	using the scrabble points hash system is better than the basic hash system (in which vowels=1 and consonants=2) because it decreases the chance/occurence of collisions (cat and dog are no longer placed in the same box)

Example:
in which A=1, B=2, C=3
NUNCHUCKS--> 14+21+14+3+8+21+3+11+19=114%10 -->4

*Point of a hash is to be unique, an identifier like a social security number.*

Networking = Sharing information
--Rules--> finding devices on the network, making connections, various types with information shared
--Finding Devices in a Network
	1. Your device must have an addressing system, capable of uniquely identifying computers and interfaces. MAC Address is the Media Access Control Address, and is also referred to as the physical address of a device. The 1st half of digits in MAC address tells manufacturer, while the last half makes them unique.
	2. You must belong to a network, which allows you to have access to shared files, devices like printers or scanners, etc. IP address stands for Internet Protocol Address, which is a temporary identifier for each interface and must also be unique among the connected devices on that network (it is changeable, shared with others in network and unique). Can get an IP address statically or dynamically (network server assigns you IP address auto, called DHCP or dynamic host configuration protocol, which is more secure because it is constantly changing).
	IPv4 is old, but commonly used. 32 bits represented in 4 sections separated by dots. Can  be public or private.
	IPv6 is new, and slowly being converted to. 128 bits represnted in 8 sections separated by colons. Each section holds a hexadecimal number from 0000 to FFFF.--> Why? Because we ran out of IPv4 addresses.

	To send data, a device must now both the IP and the MAC address of the receiving device. ARP or address resolution protocol is a tool used by devices on the same network to find the address...ARP table tells you all of the devices you've connected to and places IP next to MAC address.

	Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) is human readable.
	host, yourdomain.top-leveldomain
	top-leveldomain is like .gov .edu .com .net .org etc.
 

ifconfig -a  --> gives MAC address, IPc4, IPv6...


--Lan (Local Area Network)= devices connected inside an office, building or small geographic area of an organization for LOCAL sharing
--Wan (Wide Area Netword)= devices connected across a wide geographic area
-- What hardware does it take to deliver data?
	1. Hosts- PCs, servers, network printers, tablets, mobile phones, etc
	2. LAN central connection devices- Hub, switch, WAP, etc.
	3. WAN central connection device- router (aka default gateway), only device that can connect 2 networks
--Digital packets- older forms of comm. like analog telephones send signal across signal direct connect vs. digital comm. instead break up the signal into pieces and send them on different paths, arrive out of order but that is why they are numbered

If data is lost--> multiple copies
If data arrives in the wrong order--> number data
If data is intercepted--> encode it using like OTP

Tablet of Stone:
1. Reliability of Transmission
2. Security (in case of interception)
3. Ordering
4. Sent Receipts (verifying msg sent)


--Protocols-- TCP/IP is a set of over 100 protocols, handle diff parts of acket delivery, the protocols are stacked in layers (the ones at the botttom do the most basic tasks and ones at the top do the most specialized tasks)
	Most protocols are associated with specific port number, which indicates to a computer which application should handle incoming data (ports are like doors, opening to handle a specific type of packet), might be for security purposes!
	TCP (Transmission COntreol Protocol, connection oreinted, will makes sure the message gets there, sends error messages if there are packets missing-- something called three way handshake, est synchronized source-to-destination connection between two PCs, between sending comp and recieving comp and sending comp again-- SLOWER BTW)-- used for emails, texts, Fb messaging, and even just connecting to a web page 
					...VERSUS...
	UDP (User Datagram Protocol, doesn't check to see if the message arrives, connectionless-- typical of streaming video/music, dropping packets that aren't being recieved)--> both handle getting the connection started from host to host and send segments from host to host

	***FOR HELP CHECK OUT WEBSITE: howdns.works/ep1/***


1. Comp is set to get its IP config dynamically, so it sends out a DHCP request--> which responds with 
2. Comp sends request to the DNS server asking it to provide an IP address for the FQDN
3. Comp creates a package
4. Pc must have MAC address, but cannot get it from ARP request bc destination IP is not in our network
5. Default gateway is a router configured to have knowledge of other networks near it
6. HTTP is a connection oreinted protocol so the google web server and host PC go through a 3 way handshake to negotiate the TCP connection,, then the browser starts to access the html page with lots of packets
7. Google sends parts of web page as packets and the browser builds those to show on the screen as the Google Home page--> we can see the delivery of the page using a firefox add on called LiveHTTPHeaders


Wireshark= network packet anlyzer aka a packet sniffer, captures packets and allows the user to examine all parts of that packet including IP address info, protocols and port and actual data from inside


Note: SMTP is email
FTP is file transport protocol

Databases
--language to interact with dateabases (/retrieve info) is called SQL, has an English-like form
   Query Example:
	SELECT name, id    
	FROM person
	WHERE funfact like '%dog%'
   Which essentially means:
	SELECT *trait*
	FROM *group/table*
	Where *trait* = like *something*
    Note: the trait doesn't have to be the same both times, in fact it should probabs be different
--phpMyAdmin interacts with databases, some commands include:
	SELECT * from candy; --> shows everything in candy
	UPDATE people SET funfact="I am the professor" WHERE name="Phyllis";

	#add id#, name, password, funfact
	INSERT INTO people VALUES (76, 'Grace', 'sheep', 'I do not know');
	INSERT INTO people VALUES (200, 'Khana', 'word', 'hi hi hello');

	#changing existing rows--> UPDATE people SET name="silly" WHERE name="Bob"; 

	#view rows--> SELECT name FROM people WHERE id=4;
--What is the purpose of database systems? 
	drawbacks of using file systemd irectly to store data (redundancy and inconsistency), difficulty in accessing data, data isolation, integrity problems
--Levels of Abstraction
	Physical level: describes how a record is stored
	Logical level: describes data stored in database, and relationships among the data, what programmers have to deal with
	View level: application programs hide details of data types, vies can also hide info for secuirty purposes (i.e. employee salary)
--Design is difficult, business versus comp sci perspective
--Data Manipulation Language (DML) is the language for acessing and editing, etc data
--Tables are stored in table of tables
--How are passwords stored? Plaintext is bad, so we hash it (one way functions!).
			    Still hashes can be vulnerable, because hackers can do a dictionary 				attack where they essentially hash common words/passwords to guess 					yours.
			    Hash browns taste better with salt.--> random characters that prevent 					dictionary attacks, and ensure that your password isn't common
			    Using only lowercases it would take 26^8 tries to guess the password 					with brute force, so you want more variety, check it out at 					xkcd.com/936/
			    START USING PASSWORD MANAGER! or don't, its not a big deal for you
				maybe just log into your web browsers and log out
